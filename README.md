# Student_stress_detection_model
This project uses machine learning to predict a student’s stress level based on daily study hours, extracurricular activities, physical activity, and GPA. An XGBoost classifier is trained on real lifestyle data to provide accurate stress classification. The model supports real-time user input and outputs an interpretable stress level prediction.
Student Stress Level Prediction System

This project predicts a student’s stress level using machine learning based on lifestyle and academic factors such as study hours, extracurricular activities, physical activity, and GPA. The system uses an XGBoost classifier to learn patterns from student lifestyle data and classify stress levels accurately. It supports real-time user input to generate instant stress predictions. The project follows proper machine learning practices such as train–test splitting to avoid data leakage and ensure reliable results.

Features include stress level classification, accuracy and precision evaluation, and an interpretable prediction output. This project is suitable for beginners learning machine learning as well as for demonstrating a complete end-to-end ML workflow.
