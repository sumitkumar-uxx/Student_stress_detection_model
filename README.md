# Student_stress_detection_model
This project uses machine learning to predict a student’s stress level based on daily study hours, extracurricular activities, physical activity, and GPA. An XGBoost classifier is trained on real lifestyle data to provide accurate stress classification. The model supports real-time user input and outputs an interpretable stress level prediction.
